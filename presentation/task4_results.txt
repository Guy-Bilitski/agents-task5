Query: "What color was the key?"
Expected Answer: "Blue"

Strategy        | Method              | Result | Reason
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SELECT (RAG)    | Keyword retrieval   | ✅ PASS | Found "Blue Key"
COMPRESS        | Summarization       | ❌ FAIL | Lost color detail
WRITE           | Structured memory   | ✅ PASS | Preserved in inventory

CONCLUSION: ✅ HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED
Structured external memory (WRITE) and selective retrieval (SELECT)
preserve critical facts better than compression.
